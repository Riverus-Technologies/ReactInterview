Project Description: 

Create a React component called Counter that displays a count value and two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement."

1.The component should start with an initial count value of 0. Clicking the "Increment" button should increase the count value by 1, and clicking the "Decrement" button should decrease the count value by 1. Display the updated count value whenever it changes.
2.Add a "Reset" button that resets the count value back to 0 when clicked.
3.Display a message below the count value indicating whether the count is positive, negative, or zero.
4.Apply CSS styles to the component to make it visually appealing.

Your solution should still use functional components and React hooks.
